  <h2>Extreme heat: What does it mean for the Mediterranean Sea?</h2>

  <img src="img/img1.webp" alt="XYZ">

  <p>Extreme heat has plagued the Mediterranean for weeks. Wildfires raged across at least nine countries in the region
    from Algeria to Greece. But the soaring temperatures are not only a danger for people and ecosystems on land,
    they're also harming marine life. </p>

  <p>At the end of July, Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures hit a record 28.7 degrees Celsius (83.66 Fahrenheit),
    with some eastern parts of the waters reaching more than 30 C. Those temperatures could rise further in August,
    which is usually hotter.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt global climate change is the main reason for the heat waves in sea. It's causing the ocean to
    warm," said Katrin Schroeder, an oceanographer with the Institute of Marine Science in Italy. </p>

  <h3>But why are high sea temperatures a problem?</h3>

  <p>In a warming world, marine creatures are in danger of suffocating. Gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolve
    better at colder temperatures, so that means the warmer the water, the less oxygen is available to breathe. </p>

  <p>Conversely, higher temperatures also cause an increase in metabolism, which in turn means animals have to breathe
    even more than usual, said Diego Kersting, a marine scientist with Spain's National Research Council (CSIC). That
    combination also heightens the risk of death by starvation for marine life. </p>

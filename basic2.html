  <h2>China stops publishing youth unemployment data amid slump</h2>

  <img src="img/img2.webp" alt="">

  <p>For Annie and many young people like her, surviving in major Chinese cities seems like an endless struggle. "It's
    been very difficult for young people to find jobs, and the level of income has also been dropping," she told DW. Due
    to the sensitivity of the subject, she asked to be identified only by her first name. </p>

  <p>Despite China's economy recovering since the end of last year, when the government abolished the strict zero-COVID
    strategy, the country's youth unemployment rate remains at a record high. Official data shows that some 20.4% of
    people between 16 and 24 years of age were unemployed in April. In fact, this group is almost four times as likely
    to be jobless compared to the general population, with the overall unemployment rate at 5.2%.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, millions of college graduates are expected to join the labor market later this month. "The youth
    unemployment problem is only set to worsen probably over the next year or so," said Shehzad Qazi, managing director
    at China Beige Book, a New York-based company offering economic data from China.</p>

  <p>In a warming world, marine creatures are in danger of suffocating. Gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolve
    better at colder temperatures, so that means the warmer the water, the less oxygen is available to breathe. </p>

  <p>Conversely, higher temperatures also cause an increase in metabolism, which in turn means animals have to breathe
    even more than usual, said Diego Kersting, a marine scientist with Spain's National Research Council (CSIC). That
    combination also heightens the risk of death by starvation for marine life.</p>
